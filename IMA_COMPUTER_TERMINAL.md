# IMA_COMPUTER_TERMINAL

~In case you are wondering what the IMA_COMPUTER_TERMINAL is, it is the computer that the IMA WOOD GLUING MACHINE uses. My goal is to make it as realistic 
as the real computer. There is no interface yet, there are many updates to come big changes and fixes to be made. Be aware that this is an alpha testing
of the Terminal. I do need people to help me make this as realistic as can be. I would also like to tell you guys that if you want to take my code change
edit it or make it better feel free to do so. If you would like to contact me, contact me at int main(masters)#4371 on discord.
