# Ptyhon-projects
~ I have come back to github and as the python project suggests i will be making things in python by myself my own code also if anyone has any questions or would like to learn more text me at int main(master)#4371.

~ My goal is to be able to make something very powerful in the future. I would also like to say that i woudn't mind if you guys took my code to share it or upgrade it because that is basically why i made this repository.

~ I hope you enjoy what i am making and feel free to text me on my discord which is above.
